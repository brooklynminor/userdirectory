# User Directory

## Objective

For this assignment, you'll create a employee directory with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Criteria

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
  

## Installation

[npm i] and [npm init] to install node_modules, package.json and package-lock.json. [npm start] to run react app. [npx create-react-app <file>] to create react app. Deployed to GitHub Pages using the [Create React App docs for deployment.
